# The R script xegaSelectGene.R

The directory selectGene contains the implementation 
of a set of selection and evaluation functions for 
a genetic algorithm. 


The easiest installation is by using install.packages from R.

1. Linux:
Start R in the directory where you have stored xegaSelectGene_0.0.0.1.tar.gz

> install.packages("xegaSelectGene_0.0.0.1.tar.gz")

1. Windows:
Start R in the directory where you have stored xegaSelectGene_0.0.0.1.zip

> install.packages("xegaSelectGene_0.0.0.1.zip")

The R script xegaSelectGene.R generates

1. the man pages of the package.
2. the pdf documentation of the package.
3. the compilation and installation of the package.
   (You  must adapt the variables path and pName
    in the script selectGene.R:

    path<-"~/dev/iaa/genetic/xega/"
    pName<-"xegaSelectGene"

    to the directory where you copy the package.

You need to install the R-package devtools for this R script.

There are two ways to use the code:

1. Change into the R directory which contains the code, start R and load all code files:

source("xegaSelectGene.R")

Note that the package selectGene provides selection and evaluation functions
to all genetic algorithms of the family sgX:
sga, sgp, sgPerm, (and  sge, sgde).

Use the pdf-Manual! 

2. Adapt the path in selectGene.R and install the library selectGene:

Rscript xegaSelectGene.R

Restart R and

library(xegaSelectGene)

You get all elements of the package by

xegaSelectGene::

and pressing the tabulator.

You get the man page by e.g 

SelectLinearRank?

or 

help(SelectLinearRank)

All examples given on a man page can be executed by

example(SelectLinearRank)

Note that man pages and examples are only available, if you install 
the package as a library.
